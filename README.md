# 7Cookies 
7Cookies is a VBScript based internet radio 
client designed by Trangle and built with 
customizability in mind. It also supports local 
media files and runs them through a Windows Media 
Player interface. 7Cookies is designed to be 
hacked, customized, and rewritten.

1 - Adding directories to the internet radio list.
  Open the "stations.txt" file in a text editor and 
  add the MRL of the new station on a separate line.
  7Cookies will automatically retrieve media info.

2 - Browsing local or network files.
  Run the "7Cookieslocal.vbs" file 
  instead of "7Cookies.vbs". You 
  will be prompted to choose a file.
